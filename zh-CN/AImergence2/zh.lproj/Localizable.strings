"Excellent 3" = "请注意Little AI会在您历史记录中选择一个交互的时候，建议您下一个命令。您可以在每一轮中命令不同的历史记录中尝试一下。给出的建议命令不总是适当的，但是历史记录会帮帮助您确定那一条命令在什么情况下产生什么样的交互。";

"Excellent 14" = "During the game, you can arbitrarily interpret the directions (left or right) of the rotate commands. This interpretation may be inverted from what you see in replay mode but that's ok. The real world, if it exists, is perhaps entirely inverted from the way you see it!";
